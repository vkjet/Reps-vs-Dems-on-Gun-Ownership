# Statistical-inference-with-the-GSS-data

Among all of the variables presented in the GSS survey, gun ownership bothers me the most. Gun violence is one of the major social problems in the United States. Mass shootings, gun-related homicide, and nonfatal injuries rates are extremely high. The United States easily 'outperforms' all high-income countries on gun-related deaths including homicides and suicides as well. Almost 40,000 deaths by firearms happened in the US in 2017 (almost 109 people died per day). A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among just six countries that make up half of those fatalities. Two obvious explanatory factors are the accessibility of guns and lack of government control. Are there any personal factors that can explain such catastrophic rates?

I'm far from thinking that gun possession alone makes a person more likely to shoot someone or himself. However, not having a gun at all reduces one's chances of being an initiator of a gun violence significantly. 

Creating a 'gun owner portrait' might be the ultimate goal. But in this lab, I'm interested to find if certain political views could be the traits of a gun owner. 

So the research question is: 
**Is a person affiliated with the Republican party more likely to own a gun than one affiliated with the Democratic party?**
